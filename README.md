# hello-world
My first repository.
Hello world. I am currently learning how to program in Python. I have some experience using Java, Matlab and VBA from college but my objective now is to become a proficient programmer in Python and develop some sort of useful tool, not sure what for yet, that I can use in any of my interests. These include finance applications, Markov Decision Processes, and other probability/regression model applications which I find quite interesting.
